# introduction to research methods

- don't build novel interfaces just for the sake of novel interfaces
- design life cycle
  - methods for gathering feedback
- user-centered design
- qualitative vs quantitative data

# User-Centered design
  * considers the needs of the user throughout the entire design phase
  ^ just good design?
  - you are not the user!

## Steps
  1. need to discuss with user to figure out what they want to accomplish
  2. present design ideas and prototypes to user to get feedback
  3. evaluate quality of design

# principles of user-centered design
  1. the design is based on an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environment
    * NEEDFINDING
  2. users are involved throughout design and development
    * participatory design
  3. the design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation
  4. the process is iterative
    * tools should undergo constant feedback and change even after released
  5. the design addresses the whole user experience
  6. the design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives

# stakeholders
- primary stakeholder - user of the tool
- secondary stakeholders - do not use the tool directly but are affected by the outputs
- tertiary stakeholders - impacted by the design in some way with the existence of the tool

# the design life cycle
- needfinding
  - interviews
  - surveys
  - naturalistic observation
- design alternatives
  - brainstorming
  - personas
  - storyboards
- prototyping
  - paper prototypes
  - wireframing
  - wizard of Oz
- evaluation
  - qualitative
  - empirical
  - predictive
* then cycles back to the top

# design lifecycle meets feedback cycle
  - user does something to an interface and judges based on response.
  - the design lifecycle is akin to the feedback cycle

# qualitative vs quantitative
- quantitative : anything numeric
- qualitative : observations that are descriptive and in natural language
  - more prone to bias
- quant provides what
- qual provides how or why

* mix method - taking both qualitative and quantitative data to provide a wholistic approach

# types of quantitative data

- nominal - categorical data
  - think check boxes
  - MULTI-NOMINAL DATA - multiple check boxes
  - BINARY VS NON-BINARY
- ordinal - similar to categorical data but has ordering
  - 5:high satisfied to 1:highly dissatisfied
  - MULTI-ORDINAL DATA
  - BINARY VS NON-BINARY
- interval - at what time do you leave for work
  - 8:00 am
  - DISCRETE VS CONTINUOUS
    - discrete is countable
    - continuous, if sensors are placed.
- ratio - interval data with a zero point
  - how much time does it take for you to get to work?
    - 30 minutes

# types of qualitative data
* focused on the way that they are gathered
- transcripts
- field notes
- artifacts
- lots more!

* free form qualitative data is usually converted to some kind of quantitative data via CODING

# exploring HCI methods
how feasible is it to execute
when do you need users
  - early and often

# conclusion
needfinding, design alternatives, prototyping, evaluation
