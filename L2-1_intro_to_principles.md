# introduction to design principles
1. focus on users and tasks, not tools
2. roles of the interface in mediating users and tasks
3. different views on the roles

Apply what we learn to the broader field of HCI

# Interfaces : between Users and tasks
focus on the task rather than the interface, this will allow you to come up with the best experience to solve the task

# How to identify a task
1. watch real users
2. talk to them, figure out their goals and motives
3. start small
4. abstract up to an understanding of the task
5. YOU ARE NOT YOUR USER

*tools should be:*
-useful - interface allows users to achieve a task
-usable - ease of us

# HCI Principles

## Human role: Processor
  - take input, spit output
  - interface must: fit within human limits
  - usability: physically usable
  - evaluated by: quantitative experiments

## Human role: Predictor
  - map input to output
  - interface must: fit with knowledge
    - help the user learn what they don't know
  - evaluated by: qualitative studies
    - typically ex situ : in a controlled env

## Human role: Participant
  - interested in what the human is thinking about as well as what's going on around them
  - interface must: fit with the context
  - evaluated by: in situ : in the real world
    - observe real drivers on real roads

# User and School of Psychology
- processor = behaviorism
  - Psychology based on observable behaviors and outcomes
    - dogs salivate w/ bell
    - rat press button to get food
  - what elicits what behaviors w/ the question of WHY

- predictor = cognitivism
  - philosophical endeavor
  - tried to get AI to mimic humans and understand the human psychology

- Participant = functionalism, Systems
  - we can't disentangle behavior from the environment that it takes place
  - user + interface + environment = this

# designing with views
topic: maps app on Tesla

- Processor
  - Pro
    - may use existing data
    - enables objective comparisons
  - Cons
    - doesn't find reason for differences
    - can't differentiate by expertise
    - good for optimization, not re-design
- Predictor
  - why users find different interfaces at which time
  - Pro
    - more complete picture of interaction
    - targets different levels of expertise
  - Cons
    - analysis may be expensive
    - subject to bias
    - ignoring the broader interaction context
- Participant
  - Pro
    - evaluates interaction in context
    - captures authentic user attention
  - Cons
    - expensive to perform and analyze
    - requires real functional Interfaces
    - subject to uncontrollable variables
