# Design Alternatives

desktop, laptop, 2D, 3D?

# mistakes
- 1st biggest: jumping into design is the worst thing that can happen. 
- 2nd biggest: jumping into a certain genre of design too early
- designing often requires several iterations of :
  - brainstorming
  - tweaking
  - etc
*requires a few ideas to start with*

# the design space
- area in which we design our solution
- brainstorm possible approaches and get a large amt of possible designs

# individual brainstorming
- generate a lot of ideas
  - can be short
  - can be high level
- should start out individually
  - groups tend to coalesce around ideas pretty quickly
- things to consider : 
  - augmented reality, gesture-based controls, voice recognition?
  - generate a lot of ideas/ no matter how outlandish, because you'll never know when they come up

# exercising example
- each idea is only a few words long
- imagine the alternatives
- don't be afraid to leave and come back later
- don't cross anything out too early
- have a few change of sceneries

# 5 tips for effective individual brainstorming
1. write down the core problem
2. constrain yourself (decide 3 ideas that involve non-traditional) 
3. aim for 20 
  - this forces you to take different looks at the problem
4. take a break
5. divide and conquer
  - brainstorm solutions to individual problems

# challenges in group brainstorming
- social loafing : the tendency to exert less effort when working in a group than working alone
- conformity : tendency to agree with or follow the group's reasoning and ideas
- production blocking : the tendency of some individuals in discussions to block other individuals' participation
- performance matching: the tendency to match one's level of performance to other collaborators'
- power dynamics: the tendency to defer to more senior individuals or to overpower less senior individuals
- gender, age, race biases ... not expounded upon

# rules for group brainstorming
1. expressiveness 
  - share any ideas that come to mind
2. nonevaluation : do not criticize
3. quantity : create a lot of ideas
4. building : expound on other's ideas

5. stay focused
6. no explaining ideas
7. revisit the problem often
8. encourage others

# 5 tips for group brainstorming
1. go through every individual idea
2. find the optimal size : generally no more than 5 people
3. set clear rules for comm : get a 20 second timer
4. set clear expectations : set a clear end point
5. end with ideas, not decisions : should end with several ideas before choosing what to persuit later

# fleshing out ideas
- generating good ideas is difficult without generating a LOT of ideas
- fleshing out more ideas can activate triggers that could help you find the optimal solution

# personas
- a method to flush out designs
- create 'fake' users to test out how the design would work in their utilization

# user profile
figure out what kind of users the target audience is:
some possible choices: 
- exercise expertise
- reading level
- motivation
- tech literacy
- usage frequency

# timelines
- stretch out a persona
- "journey maps"
- annika's journey
  - decide to exercise
  - go to park
  - set up audiobook
  - exercise
  - turn off audiobook
- take into account the feelings of the user thru how they feel as they go through their timeline for exercising
- this timeline may be different for different people

# scenarios and storyboards
- scenarios are specific events that we want to handle
- timelines are general, but scenarios/storyboards are specific (particulars)
- example: fire engine
  - if a loud fire engine prevents a runner from hearing
  - maybe stop the book til after the engine passes
  - certain scenarios may play key design flaws

# user model
- how exactly the goals map to the design alternatives
- how relatively easy are design choices affect the route to completion
- more objective and gives a measurable and comparative view of the user experience

# design alternatives 

personas
- include user's context
scenarios
- includes the task context
- captures activity over time
- attempts to solve edge cases
user profile
- includes the user's context
- delineates the target audience
timeline
- captures activity over time
user modeling
- targets genearl workflow
- captures activity over time

# exploring ideas
- rule out dedicated wearable device and other unfeasible ideas

# exploring HCI : design alternatives
- figure out different ways to facilate a certain task
- EXPLORE PROBLEM BEFORE DESIGNING
- figure out different scenarios and step in the shoes of different personas

# conclusion
- design ideas
- how to synthesize ideas
- brainstorm heuristics : how to generate ideas via individual and group brainstorm
- figuring out how to trim down ideas
- select a handful of ideas to prototype
