# HCI Key Areas
Technologies - emerging tech capabilities
Domains - existing areas that could be disrupted
Ideas - theory of people interact with both of the above

# Tech : Virtual Reality
main issues : motion sickness, gesture recognition
variety of uses : gaming, tourism, commerce, art, education
  - lab in Michigan has a lab for people to face phobias

# Tech : Augmented Reality
compliments what you get from the real world (like google glass)
provide additional info based on user's interests

# Tech : UBIComputing and Wearable
ubiquitous computing : compute power anywhere
Wearable technology + heavy industrial design

# Tech : Robotics
AI that underlies their physical forms
NEW FIELD: Human Robot interactions

# Tech : Mobile
Portable computing devices built to be used easily on the go

# Idea : Context-Sensitive Computing
Context is an important part of communication
* humans may be incapable of interacting without context

# Idea : Gesture-Based Interaction
David is on camera a lot because communication is not only verbal. Gestures are important

# Idea : Pen and Touch-Based Interaction
touch screen - shortens the distance between user and task
- this has the downside of precision because fingers are not super accurate
  - pens have been used to aid this issue

# Idea : Information Visualization
data visualization
computers help us re-arrange data in complex, analytical ways
* match users' mental model to the reality of it

# Idea : Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
different time different place cooperation

# Idea : Social Computing
emojis convey ideas that are beyond the ordinary text
for prosthetic hands, that's a combination of robotics, neuroscience, and HCI

# Domain : Special needs
helping the blind visualize data

# Domain : Education
Use HCI does not always have to be positive. Could make it difficult to teach a special lesson
must have good HCI for students to learn the course material rather than the interface to convey it

# Domain : Healthcare
huge applications because there are lots of data in this field

# Domain : Security
For security to be good, they have to be usable.
Mouse checkbox uses human-like mouse gestures
password selection don't adequately convey why a certain password need to be a certain complexity

# Domain : Games
near constant feedback cycles
most criticisms are bad HCI

# Reflections : Exploring HCI
apply what you learned to an area of your choice
