# feedback cycle
how a person interacts with the world and get responses back that further dictate future actions
# agenda
  1. feedback cycle
  2. gulf of execution
    *gulf of execution: the distance between a user's goals and the actions required to realize those goals*
  3. gulf of evaluation
    *gulf of evaluation: the distance between the effects of those actions and the user's understanding of those results*
  4. 7 questions of design & how to apply

# feedback cycles are everywhere
  - read something, improve results, do better next time
  - some would say closed-loop control system is ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

  *many people define feedback cycle as the hallmark of AI*

# gulf of execution
- gulf of execution : user communicate to task via interface
  - how do they know what to do to accomplish the goal?
  - what's the diff between what the user think they have to do vs what they actually have to do?
  - is there any misunderstanding ?
  - what are the actions to make that goal into a reality? How is it going to be executed?
## steps
  1. identify intention
  2. identify actions
  3. execute in interface

#Tips for gulf of execution
  1. make functions discoverable
  2. let users mess around
    - avoid buttons that can't be undone
  3. be consistent with other tools
    control-c for copy and control-v to save
  4. know your user
    - identify intentions & actions
  5. feedforward
    - helps users predict actions

# gulf of evaluation
- reverse of the gulf of execution : pathway the task to convey action back to the user using the interface

## steps
  1. interface output
    - sound, vibrate
  2. interpretation
    - what does the vibration of smartphone mean?
  3. evaluation
    - can the user evaluate whether or not the action occurred

# Tips for gulf of evaluation
  1. give feedback constantly
  2. give feedback immediately
  3. match the feedback to the action
    - action should be proportional to the impact
  4. variable feedback
    - use haptic for other things
  5. leverage direct manipulation
    - the user to perform actions

# Norman's 7 questions to ask
  how easily can one...
  1. determine the function of the device?
  2. tell what actions are possible?
  3. determine the mapping from intent to movement?
  4. actually perform the physical movements?
  5. tell what state the system is in?
  6. tell if the system is in the desired state?
  7. determine the mapping from state to interpretation?

# car's push to start
  - consistent with where it used to be in the past

# flaw of credit card
  - it locks us into the idea of always using a credit card instead of focusing on the goal of "paying for a transaction"

# Summary

- feedback cycles : extremely necessary
- gulf of execution : how difficult is it to perform the action
- gulf of evaluation : feedback etc
- 7 questions for bridging gulfs
