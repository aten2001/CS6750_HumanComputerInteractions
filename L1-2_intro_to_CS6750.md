# Learning Goals
Overarching Goal : design effective interactions between humans and computers

1. understand common principles in HCI
2. understand the design lifecycle
  iteration is key
3. understand current application in HCI

# Learning Outcomes : "What you should learn to do after this class"

## To Design
applying feedback at the right time
using tried design principles but also working off of feedback

## Effectiveness
Goals : usability? research? change?

## between humans and computers
Designing interactions, not interfaces
how people accomplish their goals

ex. design thermostat
  - think "we're designing how people change the temperature in their home" - perspective!
  - if we set out to design a thermostat, we might design a big UI, but if we want to design a way for people to change the temperature in their home, they can design the Nest

# Learning Strategy
approach to achieve learning goals and learning outcomes
- learning by doing
- learning by reflection

*project based learning in a team*

# Learning Assessments : how we get evaluated
In the end, we will working a team to design a effective solution to a problem
  - will be judge on the effectiveness of the solution AND the process by which it was designed

# Course Structure
- discuss core design principles of HCI
- research methodologies that iteratively evolve design patterns
- outward look into what the HCI community at large is doing

# Tips
1. look over assignments early
2. start the assignments early
3. participate
4. select an application area to explore
5. leave behind what you know
