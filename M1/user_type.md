User Types: ~0.5 pages Then, outline your user types. For whom are you interested in designing? Make sure to include their demographic information, their levels of expertise, and their motivations for engaging in the task. It is fine to have a broad, diverse audience rather than a narrowly targeted one, but that diversity needs to be defined explicitly.

The intended user base would encompass the entire population of people. Every household with internet access would have a modem and router system. Because of the ubiquitous nature of routers, it is essentially for these device to have logical  troubleshooting methodologies that can be employed anywhere and by anyone. There should be at least one individual in each household who will be in charge of the maintaining the modem router system.
At the most basic level, the user should be able to use the router to troubleshoot any issues in internet connectivity. Because there exists vastly varying levels of IT experience between the general population of users, the crucial functionalities, like troubleshooting issues, should be useable for all users, and there could be additional poweruser functionalities like wifi health monitoring and speedtests to provide more persistent healthchecks of the router system.
