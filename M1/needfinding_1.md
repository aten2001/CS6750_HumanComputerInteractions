Naturalistic observation: what will you observe? Where? When? What data will you gather? Participant observation: what will you do? What steps will you follow? What data will you gather? Surveys: what will you ask? Who will you send the survey to? Interviews: what will you ask? Who will you ask? Think-aloud or post-event protocols: what will participants do? What will you ask them while or after they do it? Apprenticeship: who will you work with? What will you learn? Analysis of existing user interfaces: what interfaces will you look at? Where will you find them? Analysis of product reviews: where will you find the reviews? How will you examine them systematically? Analysis of existing data logs: where will you find the data logs? How will you examine them systematically? 

Lay out a clear plan for that needfinding exercise. The nature of the plan will differ based on the type of needfinding you select, as indicated by the questions in the list above. For all methods, you should answer the questions above in the body of your assignment; however, you should feel free to also include things like the full survey text or the full interview script in an appendix.

Make sure to connect the needfinding exercise to items from the data inventory, which is the second video in the Needfinding lesson. Each needfinding exercise does not need to address every item in the data inventory; however, generally every part of the needfinding exercise should address some item in the data inventory.

Last, specifically outline the potential biases you might encounter during this needfinding exercise. What are they, and what concrete steps will you take to limit their impact? You can find a list of some common biases in the fifth video in the Needfinding lesson. You might also find some interesting biases to address in Wikipediaâ€™s long list of biases.

There'll be 2 distinct situations that will be important to observe, and there should be a different set of questions to ask in the different situations.
