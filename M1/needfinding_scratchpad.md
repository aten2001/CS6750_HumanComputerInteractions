#Abstract: ~0.25 pages
First, include an abstract that briefly introduces your project and gives context on what task you’re addressing. You’ll include this abstract in each M assignment to give the grader and your peers context on what you’re working on. If you’d like to include more context than you can fit into 50 words, feel free to include an appendix containing an extended abstract.

Internet is a big part of everyday life for today's society. In 2012, the UN Human Rights Council declared that the "Access to the Internet should be considered a basic human right." Routers and modems are crucial parts of the process of connecting to the internet. From internet providers, the modem takes the signal from cable lines and converts the signal to a computer compatible format. Typically connected to the modem, a router box then takes the compatible signal and wirelessly transmits that information wireless to surrounding devices. Despite being an ubiquitous part of today's society, the operations around troubleshooting router issues remain largely a black box to the everyday consumer. The most common routers contain a few unintuitive light displays that flash at epileptic intervals and no real way to display wifi health and quality. For an item that is essentially the gatekeeper for everyman's wifi access, the lack of intuitive signal health monitoring and troubleshooting creates a space that is ripe for HCI improvements.

#Problem Space: ~0.75 pages
Next, define the problem space. Define the problem itself and the location in which the problem takes place, including elements of the environment surrounding the problem. This is also where you’ll define the segment of the target domain for which you’re interested in developing (e.g. the turning alerts for a navigation app or the search function for a Netflix app). You’ll develop this more when you actually carry out the needfinding exercises, but you need to have some rough idea to know where to start looking.




# User Types: ~0.5 pages
Then, outline your user types. For whom are you interested in designing? Make sure to include their demographic information, their levels of expertise, and their motivations for engaging in the task. It is fine to have a broad, diverse audience rather than a narrowly targeted one, but that diversity needs to be defined explicitly.

#Needfinding Plan 1: ~1.5 pages
With that foundation, select and plan one of the needfinding methods we’ve covered:

Naturalistic observation: what will you observe? Where? When? What data will you gather?
Participant observation: what will you do? What steps will you follow? What data will you gather?
Surveys: what will you ask? Who will you send the survey to?
Interviews: what will you ask? Who will you ask?
Think-aloud or post-event protocols: what will participants do? What will you ask them while or after they do it?
Apprenticeship: who will you work with? What will you learn?
Analysis of existing user interfaces: what interfaces will you look at? Where will you find them?
Analysis of product reviews: where will you find the reviews? How will you examine them systematically?
Analysis of existing data logs: where will you find the data logs? How will you examine them systematically?
Lay out a clear plan for that needfinding exercise. The nature of the plan will differ based on the type of needfinding you select, as indicated by the questions in the list above. For all methods, you should answer the questions above in the body of your assignment; however, you should feel free to also include things like the full survey text or the full interview script in an appendix.

Make sure to connect the needfinding exercise to items from the data inventory, which is the second video in the Needfinding lesson. Each needfinding exercise does not need to address every item in the data inventory; however, generally every part of the needfinding exercise should address some item in the data inventory.

Last, specifically outline the potential biases you might encounter during this needfinding exercise. What are they, and what concrete steps will you take to limit their impact? You can find a list of some common biases in the fifth video in the Needfinding lesson. You might also find some interesting biases to address in Wikipedia’s long list of biases.

# Needfinding Plan 2: ~1.5 pages
Repeat the steps for Needfinding Plan 1, selecting a different needfinding approach. Make sure to lay out a plan for the needfinding approach, connect the approach to the items in the data inventory, and address the biases that may come up when using that approach.

# Needfinding Plan 3: ~1.5 pages
Repeat the steps for Needfinding Plan 1 and Needfinding Plan 2, selecting a third different needfinding approach. Make sure to lay out a plan for the needfinding approach, connect the approach to the items in the data inventory, and address the biases that may come up when using that approach.
