#intro to needfinding
- requirements gathering
- biggest mistake is jumping to design without understanding the task
- if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail
- defining questions to the user

# data inventory
- who are the users? age, gender,
- where are the users? environment
- what is the context of the task?
- what are their goals?
- what do they need?
- what are their tasks?
- what are their subtasks?

# the problem space
- where is the task occurring and what tasks are going on?
- sometimes need to take a step back to take a wholistic look at the problem space
  - that way we will find a true solution rather than an implementation of a particular design

# user type
- products have to fit into a specific space dictated by the need
- in finding the niche for your product, the typical user type has to be defined and determined

# Tips to avoid bias in needfinding
  1. confirmation bias
    - we see what we want to see
  2. observer bias
    - questions might accidentally elicit the responses that we need
  3. social desirability bias
    - people want to be nice to the designer
  4. voluntary response bias
    - stronger opinions typically want to response, so responses typically come with extreme views.
  5. recall bias
    - people often recall incorrectly when remembering things from their past
    - try to ask questions and gather information in context

# naturalistic observation
- go the environment of the activity and watch
- observing what types of people are exercising and what they are doing
- downside: cannot interact with users, but this helps in curating questions to ask

# tips for naturalistic observation
  1. take notes
  2. start specific, then abstract
  3. spread out your sessions
  4. find a partner
    - observe together with someone else
  5. look for questions
    - this exercise should give you things to ask further along the process

# participant observation
- perform the activity so you do the action for yourself
- take note of what insights you gather from the experience but remember :
  - YOU ARE NOT THE USER

# hacks and workarounds
- try to observe what is happening in the hacks and workaround to see what could be done to let the user accomplish what they want within the interface
- look at their workaround and ASK WHY THEY'RE USING THEM
- errors : slips or mistake that you make while performing the task
  - may contribute

# errors
- by looking at errors that the users make, the new design could bridge this gap of work

# apprenticeship and ethnography
- ethnography : researching a particular role by becoming an expert in it
- some things might not be as easily explained by a hour or 2. By training under somebody, someone can become exposed to the industry and gain insight on how to create useful designs

# interviews and focus groups
- more qualitative but more time consuming
- focus group can have the herd mentality, which is a type of bias

# tips for conducting effective interview
  1. focus on the 6 W's
    try to ask open ended questions
  2. be aware of bias
  3. listen
  4. organize the interview
    - intro, lighter questions to build trust, summarize
  5. practice

# think-aloud
- similar to interviews, but ask them questions as they are doing the task
- may tamper with results because thinking aloud will make them think more deliberately
- can do a post-event protocol: aka, ask them after the activity is over (but the activity is still fresh in their head)

# tips for surveys
  1. less is more
    - don't ask more than you need to
  2. be aware of bias
  3. tie them to the inventory
  4. test it out
  5. iterate

# writing good survey questions
 - be clear
 - be concise
 - be specific
 - be expressive
 - be unbiased
 - be usable

# iterative needfinding
  - this can be a cycle by itself!
  - using naturalistic observation to come up with a question to ask in an interview
  - maybe ask that in a survey

# revisiting the inventory
does your needfinding answer the questions posed before?

# representing the need
to get a better feel, we can design a task by task list
- structural diagram
  - may help understand interaction and feedback loop
- task analysis

# defining the requirements
* specific and evaluatable
  - functionality
  - usability
  - learnability
  - accessibility
  - compliance
  - cost

# conclusion
  - naturalistic observation
    - analyze data that already exist
    - requires no recruitment
    - occurs within the task context
  - participant observation
    - requires no recruitment
    - occurs within the task context
    - investigates participant's thoughts
  - errors and hacks
    - analyze data that already exist
    - investigates participant's thoughts
  - interviews
    - investigates participant's thoughts
  - surveys
    - investigates participant's thoughts
    - requires no synchronous participation
  - focus groups
    - investigates participant's thoughts
  - apprenticeship
    - investigates participant's thoughts
    - occurs within the task context
  - think-aloud
    - investigates participant's thoughts
    - occurs within the task context
