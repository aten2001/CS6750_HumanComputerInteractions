First, discuss that interface from the perspective of the processor model of the user. The processor model is concerned with objective, measurable outcomes, so note the efficiency with which you can accomplish different tasks.

Second, discuss that interface from the perspective of the predictor model of the user. The predictor model is concerned with what you predict will be the outcome of your action, and whether you can interpret whether the outcome matched your prediction, so focus on how the user perceives and interprets what they should do and whether it was successful.

Finally, compare the insights you gained from each of the previous discussions. What sorts of improvements would the processor model suggest, and how do they differ from the sorts of improvements that the predictor model would suggest?

Q1. processor model discussion

## Perspective of the the user : Processor
The interface is definitely physically usable. Once all the questions and sidebar details load, they are arranged in a well organized manner for the user's digestion. There are not any extraneous movements of any pieces of the interface or animations that distract the attention of the user. At a first glance, it has the appearance of a well designed interface.
The processor view is mainly driven quantitative observations, so I decided perform some experiments on how long/how many clicks it took to perform some of the basic functions that a Piazza student would need to perform.
  1) Navigating to specific topic
    Steps:
      a) navigate mouse to secondary ribbon on the top of the web interface
      b) read from left to right through the selection of topics
        - list of topics is not sorted
      c) click on the desired topic
    Total time: 3 seconds

  2) Reading question and response threads
    Steps:
      a) click on a question from the left sidebar
        - this causes the question to populate at the top of the reading region
        - instructor responses and collective student responses subsequently follows
      b) read the main question
      c) if the question is interesting, read the instructor and/or student responses for their responses to the question
      d) when necessary, the responses could spawn additional questions
      Total Time: 10 seconds
  3) Creating a new question
    Steps:
      a) on the left sidebar, click the button labeled "new post"
      b) write out the question and fill out some metadata details around the question
      c) click post
    Total Time: 15 seconds
Overall it seems very efficient for the user to perform the key actions in very few clicks/steps.

## Perspective of the the user : Predictor
From the predictor perspective, the interface for Piazza is set up very comfortably. The interface has a lot of the key design pattern of common websites and even the browser. At the top, there are 2 ribbons, a common feature of modern day browsers and websites to represent high-level topics. When clicked on a specific topic in the ribbon, the list of questions on the left sidebar will shrink to include only the questions that are applicable to the topic that the user clicks. This allows the user to easily drill down into a topic of interest and find what he/she wants to read about.

The left bar contains the list of all the questions and announcements that has been posted to the class. This is another use of a common programming design, as most text editors have some kind of navigational menu in the same location. Rehashing these designs give the users comfort in using a design pattern that they already know. In the reading pane of the webapp, the question is laid on front and center and is followed by the instructor response and the collective students' response. This is a good design because either of one those responses will most likely be the "best fitting response" for the question posted and it makes sense for those to be placed directly below the question.

The insights gained from the processor and predictor perspectives give a full complementary analysis of the interface. The processor discussion would lead to optimizations on how a user of the interface could accomplish a task faster. These insights will have no distinction behind how the user feels about the interface and is purely focused on measureable outputs. The insights gained from the predictor discuss is more along the lines of how the design makes the user more comfortable or could be changed to be more natural to the user. It replays concepts that the user probably has already seen in other websites, and uses those comfortable design to give the user a better experience by connecting the new interface with one that they have already used and know. Additionally, the predictor model discussed the hierarchy of the quality of answers like the teacher response and the collective student response to highlight how pieces of information could be grouped together to help the students find the "best fitting" response for a particular question quickly. Both of these designs suggests improvements to the original, but the direction and reasoning of these improvements come from very different directions.
