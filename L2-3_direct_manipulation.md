# intro
- direct manipulation
  - users should be able to directly manipulate task

# direct manipulation
- moving stuff on a desktop should mimic real life -> this would make the UI more intuitive
- PREVIOUSLY, everything is done via commands on the command line
  - this is completely unlike a real desk
- INSTEAD, the mac UI is literally dragging folders and have sound notifications

# Paper Spotlight : Direct Manipulation interfaces
-  1985
  1. distance - distance between goals and object itself
    *the feeling of directness is inversely proportional to the amount of cognitive effort it takes to manipulate and evaluate a system*
    - semantic distance
      *how hard it is to know what to do*
    - articulatory distance
      *how hard it is to do what you intended*
  2. direct engagement
    *systems that best exemplify direct manipulation all give the qualitative feeling that one is directly engaged with control of the object - not with the programs, not with the computer, but with the semantic objects of our goals and intentions*

# exploring HCI : Direct manipulation and VR
  - VR is nice because it allows direct manipulation to be better utilized
  - gestures currently suffer from feedback issues
    - IRL, objects push back against you, which is difficult in VR

# babies and direct manipulation
  - direct manipulation allows babies and cats who can't normally use a keyboard and mouse
    - definitely due to the shortening in the semantic and articulatory distance

# invisible Interfaces
  *ultimate goal is for the interface between user and task to be invisible*
  - example, writing on a tablet with a stylus

# good design, bad design : invisible interfaces
 - you don't want your interfaces to be completely invisible because then it is difficult to gather feedback
 - when driving and when you're rushing at a person, it is natural for you to pump the breaks and turn the steering wheel
  - this is unrealistic to demand from our users because it is not driving and driving takes training
 - we have to make our interfaces invisible by design

# invisible by design
  - users should know immediately how to use the interface
  - get inside the users head to make sure the mental model matches design model

# 5 tips for designing invisible Interfaces
  1. use affordances
    - dials are for turning, buttons are for pushing, etc
  2. know your user
  3. differentiate your user
    - provide multiple ways of performing a task if designing for novices and expert users
      - ex. copy pasting
  4. let your interface teach
    - selecting copy paste gives hotkey shortcut
  5. talk to your user
    - get feedback, ask them what they are thinking

# summary
direct Manipulation
invisible interfaces
  - via learning
  - via design
