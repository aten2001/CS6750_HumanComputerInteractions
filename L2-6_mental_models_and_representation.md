mental model : internal, simulatable understand of external reality
- a good interface
- representations - internal symbols for an external reality
- mental models and how they apply
- representation and how they can help/hurt
- metaphors and how they can be useful tools

# mental model
- mental model : internal, simulatable understand of external reality
    - used to generate expectations and compare against model
    - people feel weird and frustrated if the mental model doesn't match up with reality

# mental models and education
- good representation shows users exactly how something works
- good UI is a seemless lesson in education

# mental models in action
- old cars have weird controls
- not a good mental model
- bad colors (red corresponds to high AC)
- nissan leaf : way better but still ways to go

# 5 tips : mental models for learnable interfaces
1. predictability
2. synthesizability - seq of buttons that led to current state
3. familiarity - leverage old interfaces
4. generalizability - knowledge of one interface should be the same as others
5. consistency - similar tasks within the same interface should behave the same way
    - behavior of a single action should be consistent

# representation
- good diagram will aid the users mental model of how different items on an interface fits together

# represenation in interfaces
- monthly representation vs weekly representation
    - different abstractions of the representation allows different tasks to be accomplished

# metaphors and analogies
- provide an easier transition by going back to what the users already know
- ex. WSJ online editing resembles the print edition 
- downside : when you use analogies to other interfaces, users may not know where the analogy ends
    - thus we need to consider what misconceptions could be introduced

# design principles revisited
- the way that something looks should tell the user how it's used
- representations are important because that helps the user predict the mapping between action and outcomes

# new functionality meets old interfaces
- eventually, we will have to teach the user unique elements of our interface

# learning curves
- every user requires some sort of learning to pick up the new interface
- rapid learning curve is what we want
- slower learning curves = bad
- use consistent conventions so the users aren't starting at level 0

# user error : slips and mistakes
- slip : the user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway
- mistake : the user has the wrong mental model, and does the wrong thing as a result

# types of slips
- action-based : doing the wrong thing
- memory-lapse : forgetting to do the right thing

# types of mistakes 
- rule-based : user correctly has the state of the world, but makes the wrong decision
- knowledge-based : incorrect state of world
- memory-lapse : forgetting to fully execute

# learned helplessness
- user learns from the output
- there's naturally a resistance to learn a difficult interface because nobody wants to fail

# learned helplessness and education
- people have learned to be helpless because they don't think they can succeed. 
- the key takeaway is to build in feedback indicators 

# expert blind spot
- when you are an expert in something, you may miss some basic steps because it seems to be second nature
- "i am not my user"

# conclusion
- what mental models are and how the user uses them to make sense of a system
- good representations can help users achieve strong mental models
- issues with interfaces can lead to 2 different kinds of user error : slips and mistakes
- learned helplessness comes from giving poor feedback in user errors (causes users to believe that he/she can't do the task)
- expert blindspot - you are not your own user
