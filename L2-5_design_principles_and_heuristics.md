# intro to design principles
- Don Norman's 6 principles of design
- constantine's and lockwood's 6 principles
- nielsen's 10 heuristics
- seven principles of universal design 
	- usability for the greatest number of people

# the sets 
the above 4 sets are combined in this lecture to form a grander set of 15 principles
1. discoverability
2. feedback
3. contraints
4. mapping
5. consistency
6. affordances
7. structure
8. simplicity
9. tolerance
10. equity
11. flexibility
12. perceptibility
13. ease
14. comfort
15. documentation

# discoverability
is it possible to figure out what actions are possible?
*instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrivable* 
- functions should be visible to the user so they can discover them

# simplicity
- the user of the design must be able to simply understand the interface's message
- messages can often be arranged to convey the information in a better way

# affordances
- the design of the object should tell you how it's meant to be utilized

# affordance vocabulary
- affordance : how the object appears to be used
- perceived affordance : how the object appears
- signifier : help the perceived affordance reach actual task

# mapping
- relationship between an interface and the world
- interface should use the language of the user
- be natural and logical 
*creating interfaces that makes it clear what the EFFECT OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE*

# perceptibility
*users ability to perceive what is going on within the system*
- need to relay necessary info effectively
- feedback must be immediate and informative
- ceiling fans have a problem with perceptibility because it goes no good feedback

# consistency
- is it better to be consistent than making tiny improvements
*uses should not have to wonder if different words, situation, or actions mean the same thing*
- reuse principle: should reuse components as much as possible
- links in texts with hyperlinks : blue text

## control-y or shift-alt-backspace
- visual studio had different hotkeys for redo

# flexibility
- different options are available because of varying skill levels
- no need to force a person on a method if they are used to a different methodology

# equity
- provide the same means for all users; identical where possible, equivalent where not
- don't stigmatize any users
- ex. requirement for passwork reset 
    - equitable treatment

# ease & comfort
- ease : design can be used efficiently and comfortably
- comfort : appropriate size and space is provided
- a bigger issue in wearable techs

# structure
*design should organize UI purposefully, in meaningful and useful ways*
- helps user match their mental model to the task
- organize things in intuitive parts and separating different concepts

# constraints
- no such thing as user error, everything should be designed to cover
- ex. visuallizing constraints so it prevents users from putting in passwords that are too easy to guess
norman's 4 types of constraints
1. physical - 3 pronged plug 
2. cultural - facing forward on escalators
3. semantic - inherent to a meaning of a situation. rear view mirror
4. logical - self-evident based on situation. Furniture building with 1 screw and 1 hole

# tolerance
how to deal with errors that occur?
- support undo and redo
- design should reduce the cost of mistakes by allowing user to redo/undo whenever possible
- a computer shall not harm your work or allow your work to come to harm

# feedback
- feedback must be immediate and informative
- if done poorly, it can be worse than no feedback, because it distracts, is uninformative, irritating and anxiety-provoking

# documentation
- users should be able to work naturally with the system
- information should be easy to search and focus on user tasks
- framed in term of tasks

# other sets of principles
3 catagories of principles:
1. learnability
2. flexibility
3. robustness

# conclusion
design principles give good guidelines but needfinding+prototyping are still necessary to determine if designs will work in reality.
