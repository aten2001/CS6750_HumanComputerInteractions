# introduction
- human abilities
  - Psychology
    - input
      - how information is digested
    - processing
      - how the human interprets
    - output
      - how the brain controls actions outside of the world

# information processing
*focus on the processor view of the human*
- how a person takes input and gives output

# sensation and perception : visual
  - good vision in the center , not good for peripheral
  - women are less likely of being colorblind
  - sight declines with age -> font size

# sensation and perception: auditory
  - non-directional, difficult to filter

# sensation and perception : haptic
  - can feel pressure, vibration but only during direct touch

# memory : perceptual store
  - perceptual store "working memory"
    - visualspatial sketchpad - visual
    - phonological loop - for sound
    - episodic buffer - ordering
     *all 3 are grouped by the central executive*
  - short-term memory
    "four to five chunks"
    *experts are better than novices at memorizing realistic chess boards*
    - takeaways
      - don't ask users to memorize too much
      - help users chunk by dividing numbers into actual chunks
  - long-term memory
