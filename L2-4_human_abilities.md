# introduction
- human abilities
  - Psychology
    - input
      - how information is digested
    - processing
      - how the human interprets
    - output
      - how the brain controls actions outside of the world

# information processing
*focus on the processor view of the human*
- how a person takes input and gives output

# sensation and perception : visual
  - good vision in the center , not good for peripheral
  - women are less likely of being colorblind
  - sight declines with age -> font size

# sensation and perception: auditory
  - non-directional, difficult to filter

# sensation and perception : haptic
  - can feel pressure, vibration but only during direct touch

# memory : perceptual store
  - perceptual store "working memory"
    - visualspatial sketchpad - visual
    - phonological loop - for sound
    - episodic buffer - ordering
     *all 3 are grouped by the central executive*
  - short-term memory
    "four to five chunks"
    *experts are better than novices at memorizing realistic chess boards*
    - takeaways
      - don't ask users to memorize too much
      - help users chunk by dividing numbers into actual chunks
  - long-term memory
    - gets here after being in short term memory several times

# cognition : learning
  - procedural learning
    - how to do something
  - declarative learning
    - knowledge about something

  - subconscious procedural -> conscious declaritive
  *we're prone to design things that are easy for us to use but difficult for other people*

# cognition : cognitive load
  - if the user has a 100% gauge, we need to understand the context of this with what other tasks the user has to perform

# tips to reduce cognitive load
  1. use multiple modalities
    - use visual, verbal, etc
  2. let the modalities compliment each other
  3. give the user control of the pace
    - gives user stress
  4. emphasize central content and minimize clutter
  5. offload tasks
    - can a part of the load/memorization be aided by the interface?
    - can show a previous part of the load

# motor system
  - example UI regarding skipping vs closing application from different locations on a mobile phone
  - there are ways to reduce the penalty for errors when buttons are close to each other

# exploring HCI : Human abilities
  - limitation of human ability are important considerations when designing

# conclusion
perception - sight, sound, touch
cognition - memory, learning
motor - how a person interacts with the world around them
